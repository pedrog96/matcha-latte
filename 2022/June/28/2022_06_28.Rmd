# Fixes in code
* I found the bug in the SVR model where the relative error was displaying too high of an error. I accidentally multiplied the relative error by 100 twice, once in the data frame creation, and once in the visualization.

# Conversations
* Tom:
    * Messaged Tom about setting up a weekly meeting to make a plan for the         week. We are planning to meet on Mondays at 10:00 am western time.
    * Tom emailed me the data set with an additional parameter in the form of
    focal distance. He sent one data set with 10,000 data points and one with        100,00 data points. He also sent the program that generates the data.
