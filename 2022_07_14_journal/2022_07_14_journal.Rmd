# Programming 

- I was able to load the csv file into a data frame. 
- The cupy library is similar to numpy but uses GPU. 
- The cudf library is a GPU DataFrame library for loading, joining, aggregating, filtering ... 
- The cuml library is for implementing GPU accelerated machine learning algorithms. The api mirrors Sklearn.
- Running the script that loads the necessary packaged takes forever.
- When I try to fit and predict data, the svr model just returns the same constant for all values.  
- I still do not understand the svr function in the cuml package
